</ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <p>To prepare Chicken Alfredo, begin by cooking 8 ounces of dried fettuccine pasta according to package instructions, and remember to reserve some pasta water for the sauce. Meanwhile, season both sides of 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 pound total) with salt and pepper. In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Cook the chicken breasts for 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach an internal temperature of 165Â°F. Once cooked, remove the chicken from the skillet and set it aside.

Using the same skillet, add 1 clove of minced garlic and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant. Stir in 1 3/4 cups of heavy cream, 4 cups of chicken broth, and 4 tablespoons of butter pieces. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.

Next, add the cooked pasta and 4 ounces of finely shredded Parmesan cheese (1 1/2 cups) to the skillet, and stir to combine. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, incorporating some reserved pasta water if the sauce is too thick. Slice the cooked chicken breasts and serve them on top of the pasta. Garnish with fresh parsley and additional Parmesan cheese, if desired. Enjoy this delicious and creamy Chicken Alfredo!</p>
