        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <p>To prepare Spaghetti Carbonara, start by cooking the spaghetti according to package instructions. In a skillet, cook pancetta or guanciale until crispy. In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain it and add it to the skillet with the pancetta or guanciale. Toss the pasta to coat it with the rendered fat. Remove the skillet from heat and quickly stir in the egg and cheese mixture, allowing the heat of the pasta to create a creamy sauce. Ensure even coating, and season with additional black pepper if desired. Serve immediately, and enjoy this classic Roman dish that celebrates the simplicity of quality ingredients.</p>
