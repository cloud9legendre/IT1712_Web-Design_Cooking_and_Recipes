        <h1>Chocolate Lava Cake Recipe</h1>
        <p>Chocolate lava cake is a small, individual-sized cake with a slightly undercooked center, resulting in a gooey, melty, and decadent treat that oozes out when cut into. It is a perfect, romantic dessert for special occasions, such as Valentine’s Day, and is often served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an indulgent treat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
  <li>6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
  <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
  <li>2 large eggs</li>
  <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
  <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>Pinch of salt</li>
  <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting</li>
  <li>Whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, for serving (optional)</li>
</ul>

        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <p>To make Chocolate Lava Cake, preheat the oven to 425°F and grease four 6-ounce ramekins with butter or cooking spray. In a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water, melt the chocolate and butter together until smooth, stirring occasionally. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg yolks, sugar, flour, and salt until well combined. Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, whisking constantly until fully incorporated. Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins.Bake for 12-14 minutes, or until the edges are set but the centers are still soft and jiggly. Remove the ramekins from the oven and let them cool for 1-2 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the ramekins to loosen the cakes, then invert them onto serving plates. Dust the cakes with powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired. Note that the baking time may vary, so keep an eye on the cakes and adjust as needed.</p>
